# Sockets
TCP/IP Communication and File Transfer Server 

This program was written like a FTP server, it could be better. It is good for students who want to learn how to write sockets 
on c language and a get a full understanding on it.

Open the terminal and type: gcc - 'nameFile.c' -o 'output' -lpthread -lm


1.- First run the 'servidor_tcp.c' file.
2.- Then run 'cliente_tcp.c'.

Regards!
